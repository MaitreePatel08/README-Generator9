# Description

When creating this project, we set out to offer the user an intuitive way to discover high rated movies by genre and find which streaming services where currently offering it. During the development process, we gained a better understanding of server side APIs, fetch requests, using third party APIs for styling, and employing the GitHub flow and VSCode to make branches and solve merge conflicts.

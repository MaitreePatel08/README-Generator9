# README-Generator9

As we know, documentation in general (and a good README file in particular) is crucial in letting other developers and potential users know what a project is about, how to install it and how to use it. With the purpose of aiding developers to be more expeditious in including documentation for their repos, we designed a simple CLI application that guides the developer through a series of prompts asking for all of the info necessary to produce a professional README.md file. Working through the challenge, provided the opportunity to learn more about the notion of modularity in Node.js, especially importing and exporting from different JS files and packages. Some of the modules where built-in in Node.js (File System (fs)), another one was installed through npm (Inquirer v8.2.4), and another one was developed by me from starting code provided at the repo specified in the Credits section. It was necessary to learn how to use the basic functionality of the Screencastify Google extension in order to provide a demonstration of the app. The demonstration gives a walkthrough of the generation of another sample README.md file that can be found in this repo.
